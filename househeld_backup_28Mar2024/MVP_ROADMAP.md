## Data Collection Goals

We need to validate these key questions:

1. **Value Proposition**: Do users actually want this service?
2. **Onboarding Friction**: Is our 5-question approach sufficient?
3. **Notification Effectiveness**: Do email reminders drive action?
4. **Content Quality**: Is our job database accurate and helpful?
5. **Engagement**: How often do users interact with the system?

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Minimum Target | Good Target | Great Target |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Onboarding Completion | 60% | 75% | 90% |
| Email Open Rate | 25% | 35% | 50% |
| Task Completion Rate | 10% | 20% | 30% |
| 30-day Retention | 20% | 30% | 50% |
| Positive Feedback | 30% | 50% | 70% |

## Post-MVP Considerations

Only if the core MVP validates our thesis, we'll consider:

1. **Survey Import Tool**: Parse PDF surveys for detailed home data
2. **Tradesperson Recommendations**: Add local provider suggestions
3. **Mobile App**: Create native mobile experience
4. **Premium Features**: Identify potential paid tier offerings
5. **Integration**: Connect with smart home devices or property management tools
